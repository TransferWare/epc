This is `EPC', the External Procedure Call toolkit. It is used to invoke
external procedures from Oracle PL/SQL.

EPC itself consists of the library, libepc.la, an IDL compiler and
the headers installed in `/usr/local/include'.

The EPC toolkit depends on the package DBUG (see
www.sourceforge.net/projects/transferware). This should be installed
into the same lib and bin directories as EPC (e.g. use the same prefix
when installing).

INSTALLATION
============

Oracle stuff
------------
First install:
- Oracle sqlplus
- Oracle proc

The most easy way to do this is to install the Oracle database (for
instance an XE version) and then the corresponding PRO*C compiler.

The following command will give you the Oracle version: sqlplus -V

This version number can be used to find the precompiler download, see
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/precomp-112010-084940.html.

Now install the proc precompiler in the same directory as the sqlplus
executable. Ensure the headers are installed in ../include.

The EPC needs to Oracle XML C SDK. Starting from Oracle 11 this is
included in the database installation. For 10 and earlier download this
from OTN and install it into $ORACLE_HOME/xdk.

An important feature is enabling/disabling server interrupts. Because
the EPC server waits forever for a message using
dbms_pipe.receieve_message, it may be difficult to stop the server
gracefully. The --enable-server-interrupt configure option enables the
EPC server to be killed by an interrupt (CTRL-C). The default is to
enable this, but this means that a second Oracle session is started
which sends an empty message into the request pipe so the EPC server can
exit. This can be disabled by --disable-server-interrupt.

GNU stuff
---------
Installation using the GNU build tools is described in INSTALL. 

Windows specific
================
For Windows platforms the Cygwin suite with GCC and the MinGW extension
can be used. There is one caveat: the libraries should not depend on the
Cygwin DLL, but on the Microsoft run-time DLLs instead. See the file
BUGS in the DBUG distribution for more information.

Solaris specific
================
On SUN Solaris version 9 or higher the library libm has to be added to
the list of libraries, because the Oracle xml library libxml10 needs
it. 

The configure script will try to set the environment correctly. In case
that fails the following configure command may be tried:

./configure LIBS="-lm"

BUILD
=====
First follow the BUILD instructions in the DBUG README.

DIST
