This is `EPC', the External Procedure Call toolkit. It is used to invoke
external procedures from Oracle PL/SQL.

EPC itself consists of the library, libepc.la, an IDL compiler and
the headers installed in `/usr/local/include'.

The EPC toolkit depends on the package DBUG
(see www.sourceforge.net/projects/transferware). This should be
installed into the same lib and bin directories as EPC (e.g. use same
prefix when installing).

INSTALLATION
============
Installation using the GNU build tools is described in INSTALL. 

Installation using imake is described in README.imake. This is not
supported anymore.

Windows specific
================
For Windows platforms the Cygwin suite can be used. There is one caveat:
the libraries should not depend on the Cygwin DLL, but on the Microsoft
run-time DLLs instead. See the file BUGS in the DBUG distribution for
more information.

On Windows systems the environment variable ORACLE_HOME must be known to
the configure script. The value must have the following syntax:
<drive>:/<Oracle directory path>. Without this the value for ORACLE_HOME is
determined by the path to the PRO*C compiler which will result in
something like /cygdrive/<drive>/<Oracle directory>. This will confuse
the MinGW compiler.

An example for Windows:

./configure --prefix=c:/usr/local ORACLE_HOME=c:/oracle/ora81 CC="gcc -mno-cygwin"
