This is `EPC', the External Procedure Call toolkit. It is used to invoke
external procedures from Oracle PL/SQL.

EPC itself consists of the library, libepc.la, an IDL compiler and
the headers installed in `/usr/local/include/epc'.

Installation using imake is described in README.imake.

Installation using the GNU build tools is described in INSTALL. 

Windows specific
================
For Windows platforms the Cygwin suite can be used except for the
compiler because the Cygwin DLL and the Microsoft Visual C++ run-time
DLL will be linked together which will result in problems. Therefore a
different compiler is needed. A good choice is the MinGW compiler or the
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.

The EPC toolkit depends on the package dbug. On Windows systems this
package too must have been built with the same compiler. To separate
programs and libraries (DLLs) built without the Cygwin run-time DLL,
these programs should be installed outside the Cygwin environment. The
directory c:/usr/local and its subdirectories can be used as
installation targets.

On Windows systems the environment variable ORACLE_HOME must be known to
the configure script. The value must have the following syntax:
<drive>:/<Oracle directory>. Without this the value for ORACLE_HOME is
determined by the path to the PRO*C compiler which will result in
something like /cygdrive/<drive>/<Oracle directory>. This will confuse
the MinGW compiler.

An example for Windows configuration:

./configure CC=C:/MinGW/bin/gcc --prefix=c:/usr/local CPPFLAGS=-Ic:/usr/local/include LDFLAGS="-Lc:/usr/local/lib -ldbug" ORACLE_HOME=c:/oracle/ora81
