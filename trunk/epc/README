This is `EPC', the External Procedure Call toolkit. It is used to invoke
external procedures from Oracle PL/SQL.

EPC itself consists of the library, libepc.la, an IDL compiler and
the headers installed in `/usr/local/include'.

The EPC toolkit depends on the package DBUG
(see www.sourceforge.net/projects/transferware). This should be
installed into the same lib and bin directories as EPC (e.g. use same
prefix when installing).

INSTALLATION
============
Installation using the GNU build tools is described in INSTALL. 

Windows specific
================
For Windows platforms the Cygwin suite with GCC and the MinGW extension
can be used. There is one caveat: the libraries should not depend on the
Cygwin DLL, but on the Microsoft run-time DLLs instead. See the file
BUGS in the DBUG distribution for more information.

An example for Windows using the Cygwin GCC compiler:

./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/cygdrive/c/usr/local/include" \
LDFLAGS="-L/cygdrive/c/usr/local/lib" \
CC="gcc -mno-cygwin" --prefix=/cygdrive/c/usr/local

Solaris specific
================
On SUN Solaris version 9 the library libm has to be added to the list of
libraries, because the Oracle xml library libxml10 needs it. This can be
done by specifying LIBS=-lm on the configure command line. For 64 bit
architectures this should be LIBS=-lm64.
