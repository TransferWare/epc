This README describes how to invoke the regression test.

Invoke the regression test by:

  $ imboot -C EPA ..
  $ make test

No errors should occur.

On DOS/Windows platforms you need a Korn (ksh), Bourne (sh) or Bash (bash)
shell. The make command now is:

  DOS> <make executable> SHELL=<shell> TOP=<path of DBUG with a slash (/) as separator> test
