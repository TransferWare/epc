Release 5.0.0

* Added XMLRPC protocol.
* Added native dbms_pipe protocol without the overhead of XMLRPC and SOAP.
* The procedure empty_pipes (util/empty_pipes.prc) now removes pipes
  after emptying them.
* The epc_clnt package has a new procedure shutdown for cleaning up 
  resources (response database pipes).
* The IDL compiler now generates both C and PRO*C files with the 
  same functionality. Only one of them is needed to compile your 
  application.
* The installation directories from the DBUG package are used.
* On Solaris the math library (-lm) is added to $LIBS (if unset).
* Package dbug can be used or not (--without-dbug).
* Backwards compatibility for subtypes and exceptions which are part of
  the EPC package specification.
* The feature server-interrupt has been added to configure. See the
  README.
* The manual describes how to recover from EPC communication errors 
  (epc.e_comm_error).
* The EPC communication error message can be retrieved via SQLERRM
  instead of DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINE(S).
* Several portability issues solved for Solaris (rpt_malloc, strtof).
* The first (shared) library to try for xmlinit is now -lnmemso, which
  solved linking problems on the Mac OS X, because libxml10.a is a
  static library.
* The EPC library has been checked for allocation errors using dmalloc
  (http://dmalloc.com/).
* Generated PL/SQL packages now have bounds checking enabled for
  strings.
* EPC exceptions have been mapped to error numbers.
